Planned features for the future, in no particular order, with notes.

### Draft helpers

- **Player search/lookup from Hotslogs.** If we can display the most relevant info about players this would be nice to save some ALT+TABs.
- **Counter picks.** Every bit of info helps. But where to get the data? Crowdsourced? Some hotslogs chart?
- **Bans**

### Quality of Life improvements

- **Automatic replay upload to Hotslogs.** Lot's of questions, but a requested feature and seems to be a good idea.
- **Better team composition page.** More data, better images, better UI.
- **Analytics, error reporting.** More important for me, helps to know what is going on with the app.
- **Notifications** Display errors or current news/information. Updates on service interruptions, ask for reviews, etc.
- **Map objective timer** Help users with map objective timings. Mercs, objectives, anything. (Inspiration from [hots-objective-timer.com](hots-objective-timer.com))

### New features

- **Share/save your talent builds.** Suggested by [Zweer](https://github.com/Zweer). Needs fleshing out.
- **Commend system** Maybe a positive feedback loop could help decrease the toxicity. So far we only have negative loop (report).
- **LED API integration.** On some Logitech keyboards. Not important, but the API is now in Overwolf, so why not?
- **Historical data display.** Charts. Beautiful charts. Everyone loves chart. Especially pies.
- **News Bar** Display stats/facts/results of ongoing eSport events in a small bar, news channel style. (?)
- **Save hero league stats** Record the end-of-match results and aggregate them to a nice graph. My performance this season or something like that.
